# FEWD1-Final-Group-Project
Front End Web Development - 1 

Final Course Project
For the final project in this course, you will be tasked with demonstrating the skills that you’ve learned throughout this certificate program. Your job will be to construct a full-functioning and interactive website that demonstrates all of the skills that you’ve acquired throughout this course. These skills include basic and intermediate HTML5 authoring skills, CSS3 structuring, formatting, and interactive skills, third-party framework usage, Responsive Web Design, JavaScript and jQuery, Forms, and more. The completed team-based project will be a culmination of everything you’ve learned and in order to receive maximum points (200), the successful team should make sure that their completed project touches on the points outlined in the following rubric.

10 Points
Your project’s folder structure should be well thought out. This will include appropriate folder names including assets, css, js, images, etc. HTML files should appear within the root of the project. The HTML documents should be formatted according to HTML5 standards. The HTML5 shiv library should be referenced as well as the normalize.css library. (*Do not include any items within your directory structure that are not needed for your site to function).

15 Points
Your markup should use HTML5 section elements for structure and grouping and inline text-level semantic elements for everything else. As it relates to structure, make sure to use header, nav, section, footer, aside, and address tags where applicable. Of course you may use them more than once and of course, they can be nested within each other. The navigation menu should have a minimum of 5 links, constructed using an unordered list, and some kind of “fly out” must be implemented that outlines at least 5 more links for a total of 10 web pages minimum. You can achieve this menu by using CSS3. The HTML should be properly commented so that the instructor may quickly see the different areas of the document. Use a validator to ensure code is error free.

10 Points
The website should include a minimum of 10 web pages. Each web page should link seamlessly between each other with no broken links (internal or external). At least 1 mailto: link should appear somewhere within the website. At least 3 images must appear on the website. This does not include any backgrounds that you may decide to add within CSS.

10 Points
Incorporate at least 1 Web Font to the website. Make sure to provide appropriate fall-back content.

10 Points
CSS should be implemented to define the structure and formatting of the website. An external style sheet should be created and properly linked into each page of the website. No embedded or inline styles should be defined. You must utilize 7 selector types which may include IDs, classes, descendant, type, pseudo-class, sibling, adjacent sibling, etc. The CSS should be properly commented so that the instructor may quickly see the different areas of the document. Use a validator to ensure code is error free.

10 Points
The website is properly formatted with CSS. This includes relying on background colors and images, font weights, line heights, colors, and more to make the website’s appearance stand out. Make sure that your website seperates out structure form visual design and assigns each to the appropriate area of the site.

10 Points
The website is properly structured with CSS. This includes relying on the box model properties to set dimensions including widths, heights, paddings, margins, borders, etc. (use shorthand whenever possible). Correct use of selector types must be demonstrated. All CSS should be free of errors.

10 Points
The CSS should be organized and optimized. You will need to create a minified version of your CSS for deployment but make sure you also have a un-minified version that contains comments and is well organized. Please have your submitted project reference the un-minified version of the CSS but do include minified versions of all CSS files that you would be using at deployment.

30 Points
At least 3 uses of jQuery should be used to add interactivity to your website, you can create custom code or use a plugin). For instance you might decide to have a carousel of images on the main page, an accordion to show/hide testimonials, collapsible panels, a to top image that jumps the user back up to the top of the web page, etc. Be creative here but you must have at least 3 jQuery plugins. Make sure the jQuery you choose to incorporate is appropriate for your website.

20 Points
A contact form exists. The contact form includes the following form controls:
